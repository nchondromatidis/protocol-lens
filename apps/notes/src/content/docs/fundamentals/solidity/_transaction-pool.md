This is because of the nature of ethereum transaction processing:

- when a trader submits a transaction, it gets to the node's transaction pool
- the node then propagates the submitted tx to other nodes
- once a node is promoted to miner, it chooses which tx to add to the block and at which order
  - the time that the tx is submitted does not guarantee the tx block order picked by the miner
